# Generate unique column based on database ID

## Requirements
Using autogenerated id column (primary key) from PostgreSQL databases, populate a hash value for another column "inventory_id"

## Issue
To indetify uniqueness of record we have to use primary key column (or group of columns) which will give us unique record for databases. When user make a post request via our API, "id" column is not available. 
Becuase we don't want to maintain  uniqueness on API side, we want database automatically generate unique number.
And, since we don't know "id", how can we generate "inventory_id" column?
